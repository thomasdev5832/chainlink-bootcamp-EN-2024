# Chainlink Bootcamp EN 2024

[Slides]()

## Day 1
**[Fundamental Blockchain Concepts and Wallets](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G7V-G7RURDI)**

- Creating wallets in MetaMask, Account1 and Account2
- Get Sepolia ETH from faucet for Account1
- Transfer from Account1 to Account2 0.1 Sepolia ETH

## Day 2
**[Solidity Fundamentals](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5YwxmuWIcw)**

### Creation of the Register.sol smart contract
This contract is very basic that allows obtaining and establishing a single chain of information.

### Creating the RegisterAccess.sol smart contract

This contract is a simple access control system that allows the owner to manage a list of information, control access to certain functions, and monitor changes through events.

## Day 3
**[Oracles, ERC20 Tokens, and Chainlink Data Feeds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1sBc1YFgus)**

### Creation of the Token.sol smart contract

This contract creates the token. Extends the OpenZeppelin ERC20 and AccessControl contracts. 

This token contract introduces a role-based access control mechanism, allowing certain addresses with MINTER_ROLE to create (mint) new tokens. 

Total supply, balances and token transfers follow standard ERC-20 behavior inherited from the OpenZeppelin ERC20 contract.

### Creation of the TokenShop.sol smart contract

This is where the token created comes from â€” itats a simple dApp (decentralized application) that acts as a token store, allowing users to purchase tokens by sending ETH to the contract. 

This contract relies on an external Chainlink oracle to obtain the ETH/USD price.


## Day 4

**[Cross-Chain Tokens Using Chainlink CCIP](https://www.youtube.com/live/5IFeP0gdcpM?si=MriUBCNBkFYNvoyv)**

Creation of the CCIPTokenSenderFujiSepolia.sol smart contract

Here we use Cross Chain Interoperability Protocol to transfer Chainlink CCIP messages from the AVAX Fuji testnet to the Sepolia Ethereum testnet. 

It involves building and sending a CCIP message, managing fees on LINK tokens, and allowing the contract owner to withdraw the remaining tokens. 

The destination chain selector (destinationChainSelector) is set on the Sepolia testnet.

Chainlink Automation: Decentralized smart contract automation

Decentralized netowk of nodes. Which are rewarded for running registered processes (jobs), called Upkeeps.

They can be used to verify conditions and send transactions to smart contracts according to pre-established reules. It is the active agent that will interact with a smart contract.

- Smart contracts are NOT self-executing
- They cannot alone start a process or call its functions from time to time or under certain conditions
- Changes in the state of a smart contract only happen when a transaction is initiated by another account
- Examples: a user, oracle or other smart contract
